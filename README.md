Perfect! I can take your provided README draft and **adapt it for your JSLPP Kanban Task Board** with your modular code and API/localStorage functionality. Here’s a polished version:

# 📌 JSLPP – Kanban Task Board

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project builds a **dynamic Kanban Task Board** in the browser. Tasks are displayed in three columns: **TODO, DOING, DONE**, and can be added, edited, or deleted directly on the page. Each task is stored as an object with its **id, title, description, and status**.

Tasks are initially fetched from an API, with a **fallback to localStorage** if the API is unavailable. Clicking a task opens a **modal (pop-up)** for viewing and editing details. The board updates in real-time based on user interactions.

## ✨ Features

- Tasks stored as objects in an array
- Fetch tasks from API; fallback to localStorage if API fails
- Dynamic rendering of tasks in the correct column based on status
- Click task to open **edit modal** with title, description, and status
- Add new tasks through **new-task modal**
- Delete tasks with confirmation
- Modal can be closed with ✕, backdrop click, or **Esc**
- Dark/light theme toggle (desktop + mobile)
- Collapsible sidebar and mobile overlay menu
- Responsive layout: 3 columns on desktop → 2 on tablet → 1 on mobile

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – page structure for sidebar, header, board, and modals
- **CSS3** – styling for board layout, cards, modals, responsive design, and themes
- **JavaScript (ES6 Modules)** – modularized code for:

  - `main.js` → initialization, status banners, wiring UI
  - `api.js` → fetching tasks from API
  - `tasks/taskManager.js` → CRUD operations
  - `ui/` → modals, sidebar, mobile menu, theme, rendering tasks

If you want, I can also **make a version with screenshots and live GIF examples** of the board in action, which will make your portfolio piece **stand out even more**.

Do you want me to do that next?
